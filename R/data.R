#' Codon Table
#'
#' codon_table: After the transcription process, you have mRNA sequence and we use this mRNA sequence to produce a functional protein (aminoacid sequence).
#' To produce this amino acid sequence, we use codon (which are basically 3 bases of mRNA starting from position one, start codon).
#' We use this codon table to produce our amino acid sequence. For each codon we have our speicif amino acid with its own biochemical properties.
