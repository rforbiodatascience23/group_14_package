Description: This package focuses on transcription and translation, which are two main processes involved in gene expression.    
             Transcription is a process of producing mRNA sequence from the coding sequence of a gene.    
             Whereas, translation is the process of producing a functional protein using the genetic code encoded in the mRNA sequence.
